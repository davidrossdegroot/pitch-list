# Pitch: Smart Bins

## Problem Context
Neighborhood trash build-up due to infrequent public bin emptying.

## Proposed Solution
Deploy community-managed smart bins that notify when full.

## Impact Estimate (1–5)
5

### Impact Rationale
> Based on DC Department of Public Works 2023 data, 40% of trash complaints are overflow-related. Smart bins in similar cities reduced overflow incidents by ~60%, suggesting a 20–25% total reduction in complaints for DC.

## Level of Effort Estimate (1–5)
3

## Scope (Shape Up style)
- **Appetite**: 6 months of development and community engagement.
- **Boundaries**: Excludes private property bin management.
- **No-Gos**: No reliance on traditional bin emptying schedules.

## Why This Could Work
Cities that have implemented smart bins have seen significant reductions in overflow and associated complaints, improving community cleanliness and satisfaction.

## Risks
- Initial resistance from community members.
- Technical failures in bin notifications.
- Funding challenges for installation and maintenance.

## Success Metrics
Reduce trash overflow complaints by 50% in 6 months.
