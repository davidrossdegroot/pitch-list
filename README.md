## Problems
This repo contains a list of major problems that Washington DC has today. The intent is to be a place to go to find "work" to do in DC that is meaningful.

### Definitions
- *Problem*: An issue that Washington DC faces such as climate change or mental health concern or poverty.
- *Pitch*: Each problem may have different "Pitches" associated to them. These roughly align to a ["shape-up pitch"](https://basecamp.com/shapeup). These contain small descriptions of the problem, the scope of the pitch, some data describing how this pitch will help, andd the solution. A pitch could belong to multiple problems. Generally pitches should take a small team of people 2-8 weeks to complete. E.g. A coffee shop helps prevent loneliness, and fights poverty with jobs. Each pitch should have opportunities to help people find grants, competitions (e.g. a competition for how to grow tomatoes with less waste), or other monetary opportunities (e.g. a coffee shop would provide monetary opportunity for a business owner).

### Why this helps
This seems like a pretty basic project but what makes this interesting is that it will be AI shepherded. At different intervals, jobs will run that could:
- add more pitch ideas
- analyze user created pitches and provide feedback via pull requests
- find associated opportunities

##
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
