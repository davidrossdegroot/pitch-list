# Problem: Excessive Screen Time in Children

## Overview
Children today spend unprecedented amounts of time on digital devices—phones, tablets, gaming consoles, and computers. While screens can provide educational value and entertainment, excessive use is linked to negative outcomes including sleep disruption, reduced physical activity, mental health challenges, and impaired social development. Addressing this issue matters for long-term health, well-being, and the ability of young people to engage meaningfully with the real world.

## Key Data & References
- U.S. children ages 8–12 spend an average of 4–6 hours per day on screens, and teens spend up to 9 hours (Common Sense Media, 2021).  
- Excessive screen time is associated with higher rates of anxiety, depression, and attention difficulties in youth (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2020).  
- The World Health Organization recommends children ages 5–17 get at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily, which excessive screen use often displaces.

## Opportunities
- **Public funding:** CDC and NIH grants for child health and mental well-being.  
- **Education initiatives:** Government programs funding digital literacy and wellness curricula.  
- **Private sector:** Corporate social responsibility programs from tech companies (Google, Apple, Microsoft) often fund digital wellness initiatives.  
- **Competitions:** "Apps for Good" and "Tech for Humanity" challenges regularly feature wellness categories.  

## Suggested Next Steps
- Pilot "Screen-Free Saturdays" in a few neighborhoods to build early momentum with low effort.  
- Partner with schools for integration of a digital literacy module.  
- Explore funding for app-based or curriculum-based interventions.  
- Recruit volunteers for outdoor play clubs (ideal for parents, coaches, or community leaders).
